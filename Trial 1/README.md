# Thermograms Classification To Breast Cancer Detection Using Statistical And Fractal Texture Features Extraction

It is a step-by-step project on Thermograms Classification to Breast Cancer Detection Using Statistical and Fractal Texture Features Extraction

Read DATA_HELP.txt in total_dataset folder
There are 100 healthy images whose names start with the letter "N" and also 100 images for Breast cancer whose names begin with the letter "C"


you will learn hwo to:

1)Loading Data   
2) RGB2gray conversion  
3) Applying Histogram Equalization    
4) 2-D median filtering     
5) Fast Local Laplacian Filtering     
6) Converting Images to double precision
